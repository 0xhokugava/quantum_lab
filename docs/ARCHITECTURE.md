# Architecture

Project separates circuit construction from low-level state-vector execution.

Custom CLI circuit follows this path:

```text
command-line arguments
→ GateSpec parsing
→ qubit validation
→ Circuit construction
→ state-vector execution
→ Dirac notation output
```

Example:

```bash
eigenon run --qubits 2 --gate h:0 --gate cnot:0,1
```

## Circuit API

Circuit API stores quantum operations in execution order and dispatches them to the simulator backend.

```
let mut circuit = Circuit::new(2);
circuit.h(0).cnot(0, 1);
let state = circuit.run();
```

Measurement remains separate from deterministic circuit execution.

## State-Vector Representation

An `n`-qubit state is stored as a complex vector containing `2^n` amplitudes.

For two qubits:

```text
index 0 → |00>
index 1 → |01>
index 2 → |10>
index 3 → |11>
```

The simulator provides helpers for:

* Dirac notation formatting
* probability calculation
* normalization checks
* state comparison with numerical tolerances
* shot-based measurement

## Qubit Ordering

Eigenon uses little-endian qubit indexing:

```text
q0 = least significant bit
```

Printed basis states use standard binary notation, so `q0` appears as the rightmost bit.

```text
X(q0) |0000> = |0001>
```

Controlled gates use:

```text
cnot(control, target)
cz(control, target)
mcx(controls, target)
mcz(controls, target)
```

For generic local gates:

```text
targets[0]     → most significant local matrix bit
targets[k - 1] → least significant local matrix bit
```

The same convention is used by the Circuit API, CLI, dense baseline, and matrix-free execution engine.

## Matrix-Free Execution

The primary execution path updates the state vector directly. Single-qubit gates operate on amplitude pairs that differ in the selected qubit bit.

Generic `k`-qubit gates operate on local blocks of `2^k` amplitudes without constructing a full-system matrix. State-vector memory complexity remains:

```text
O(2^n)
```

Temporary local storage depends on the gate width:

```text
O(2^k)
```

## Dense Baseline

Eigenon also keeps a dense full-operator implementation for correctness verification. The dense path is not intended for scalable execution. It is used as an independent baseline for comparing matrix-free results.

## Supported Operations

Single-qubit gates:

```text
I, X, Y, Z, H, S, T
```

Two-qubit gates:

```text
CNOT, CZ
```

The generic execution engine can also apply arbitrary local `2^k × 2^k` gate matrices.

## Algorithms

Current algorithm demonstrations include:

* Deutsch
* Deutsch–Jozsa
* Grover search

Deutsch–Jozsa has been compared against Qiskit. Grover validation is planned after its gate-level decomposition.

## CLI Gate Representation

CLI gate strings are parsed into typed `GateSpec` values:

```text
h:0
x:1
cnot:0,1
cz:1,2
```

Responsibilities are separated:

```text
FromStr     → parse syntax
validate    → check circuit compatibility
apply       → add the operation to Circuit
```
